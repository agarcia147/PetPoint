# PetPoint
A simple and reliable Python-based scheduling system designed to help pet groomers efficiently organize appointments, clients, and services.

Overview:

PetPoint offers a digital solution for appointment management tailored to pet groomers and grooming salons. Many groomers still depend on handwritten notes, phone messages, or disorganized spreadsheets to manage appointments, which can result in missed bookings and confusion. PetPoint streamlines this process by providing a digital method for scheduling that is both fast and reliable. With PetPoint, groomers can effortlessly add, view, and search for appointments. Each appointment entry contains the pet's name, the owner's information, a contact number, the type of service required, and the appointment's date and time. The aim is to deliver a straightforward and effective tool that helps groomers remain organized, minimize scheduling mistakes, and enhance customer satisfaction.
